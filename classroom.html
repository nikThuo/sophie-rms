                        This is about making the learning process more meaningful through collaborative learning
                        activities that enhance student agency/ownership. The aim here is to ensure content
                        delivery supports the following classroom themes:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Communication and Collaboration</li>
                        <li>Critical thinking</li>
                        <li>Creativity</li>
                    </ul>

                    In this section resources will include:
