                        The school is viewed as a whole â€“ with sections that support each other through respective
                        functions working interdependently. Due to the interdependent nature of school systems,
                        there are sections that would benefit from enhancement in order to contribute effectively
                        to the entire system. Themes under this focus area will include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>School improvement strategies</li>
